4,000 students consist of KEEP. Each 2,000 students were either in their final year of high school or of middle school in 2004^[A half of the students were either 17 or 18 years old, and the other half were 14 or 15 years old in 2004]. The interviewers from KRIVET did not only ask students about their school life but also asked their parents and teachers questions related to students' households and schools. 

Note that I only use the cohort of students who were in their last year in high school in 2004.
