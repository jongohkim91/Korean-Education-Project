# Korea Education Project

The main objective of this project is to explore the reality of Korean students and see whether any external factor, either it is from a student's household or school, plays a substantial role in a student's academic achievement or one's late future labor market success.

This project is based on Korean Education and Employment Panel (KEEP) data created and maintained by Korea Research Institute for
Vocational Education & Training (KRIVET). For obtaining the data please visit [https://www.krivet.re.kr/ku/index.jsp](https://www.krivet.re.kr/ku/index.jsp)
